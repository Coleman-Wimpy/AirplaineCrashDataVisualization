* MapVisualization.js - Coleman Wimpy
   * Initialize variables to set the map to the div element with the id of mapVisId and set the map tiles
   * Initialize an array to hold the names of all the crash locations
   * Initialize a JSON object to hold the number of crashes for each location
   * Initialize the global count variable to 0, this will be used to loop through the location array
   * Try catch statement to call the getData function and log any errors if they occur
   * Async function getData
      * Set variable response to await the response of fetch function that grabs ‘full_test.csv’
      * Set variable data to the text version of the response
      * Set variable table to an array, each array element is a line from the csv file, which is a data point
      * For loop
         * Split each line in the array by commas, unless the comma is inside quotes, and assign this array to a variable col
         * Variable location is set to the 3rd item from a line of data
         * If statement checks if locationList contains that location, if yes increase the count for that location by 1 in the total crash object ,if no then add that location into the array of locations, and set the value of that location to 1 in the total crash object
      * Once the for loop is over, call the getCoords function
   * Async Function getCoords
      * setTimeout that calls an anonymous async function after 300 ms
         * Set the url to contain the location that needs coordinates 
         * Fetch the response from that url 
         * Set the popup message to be displayed when a marker is clicked on
         * Set the icon that the markers will use
         * Add the marker at the latitude and longitude that is returned from the api and assign it the icon and popup message
         * Increase the count variable by 1
         * If count is less than the length of the locationList array call the getCoords function again
